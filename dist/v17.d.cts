/**
 * Frozen entry point for bypp format **v17**, imported as `bypp-format/v17`.
 *
 * It re-exports every v17 schema/type under a stable, version-less name
 * (`WidgetSchema`, `StyleSchema`, `BeyondPaperSchema`, …) bound to the v17
 * versioned schema. Unlike the package root (`bypp-format`), whose aliases
 * always track the LATEST shipped version, this entry never moves: a consumer
 * that pins to `bypp-format/v17` keeps compiling against v17 no matter how far
 * the format advances. To adopt a new version, a consumer switches its import
 * path (`bypp-format/v17` → `bypp-format/v18`) deliberately.
 *
 * The v17 headline is on `TagSchema` and `TagCategorySchema`: both can name an
 * icon. The reference icon registry is NOT re-exported here: it belongs to no
 * version, validates nothing, and adding a slug to it never moves the format.
 * Reach it deliberately at `bypp-format/icons`.
 *
 * This file MUST NOT be modified once shipped — add `v18.ts` for the next one.
