/**
 * Frozen entry point for bypp format **v19**, imported as `bypp-format/v19`.
 *
 * It re-exports every v19 schema/type under a stable, version-less name
 * (`WidgetSchema`, `StyleSchema`, `BeyondPaperSchema`, …) bound to the v19
 * versioned schema. Unlike the package root (`bypp-format`), whose aliases
 * always track the LATEST shipped version, this entry never moves: a consumer
 * that pins to `bypp-format/v19` keeps compiling against v19 no matter how far
 * the format advances. To adopt a new version, a consumer switches its import
 * path (`bypp-format/v18` → `bypp-format/v19`) deliberately.
 *
 * The v19 headline is the link between entities: the `entityRef` and
 * `entityLookup` variables and the `entityGrid` widget. The reference icon
 * registry is NOT re-exported here: it belongs to no version, validates
 * nothing, and adding a slug to it never moves the format. Reach it
 * deliberately at `bypp-format/icons`.
 *
 * This file MUST NOT be modified once shipped — add `v20.ts` for the next one.
