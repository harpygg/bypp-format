/**
 * Frozen entry point for bypp format **v14**, imported as `bypp-format/v14`.
 *
 * It re-exports every v14 schema/type under a stable, version-less name
 * (`WidgetSchema`, `StyleSchema`, `BeyondPaperSchema`, …) bound to the v14
 * versioned schema. Unlike the package root (`bypp-format`), whose aliases
 * always track the LATEST shipped version, this entry never moves: a consumer
 * that pins to `bypp-format/v14` keeps compiling against v14 no matter how far
 * the format advances. To adopt a new version, a consumer switches its import
 * path (`bypp-format/v14` → `bypp-format/v15`) deliberately.
 *
 * This file MUST NOT be modified once shipped — add `v15.ts` for the next one.
