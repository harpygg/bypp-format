/**
 * Frozen entry point for bypp format **v15**, imported as `bypp-format/v15`.
 *
 * It re-exports every v15 schema/type under a stable, version-less name
 * (`WidgetSchema`, `StyleSchema`, `BeyondPaperSchema`, …) bound to the v15
 * versioned schema. Unlike the package root (`bypp-format`), whose aliases
 * always track the LATEST shipped version, this entry never moves: a consumer
 * that pins to `bypp-format/v15` keeps compiling against v15 no matter how far
 * the format advances. To adopt a new version, a consumer switches its import
 * path (`bypp-format/v15` → `bypp-format/v16`) deliberately.
 *
 * Note there is no `DialectFontSchema` here: v15 replaced the dialect's
 * `{ fontFamily, fontUrl }` object with a bare `fontFamily` name.
 *
 * This file MUST NOT be modified once shipped — add `v16.ts` for the next one.
